### Create bulk user accounts

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) supports bulk user create and delete operations and supports downloading lists of users. Just fill out the comma-separated values (CSV) template. You can download the template from the Azure AD portal. To create users in the Azure portal, you must be signed in as a Global administrator or User administrator.

#### Things to consider when using the template

- Naming conventions. Establish or implement a naming convention for usernames, display names, and aliases. For example, a user name could consist of last name, period, first name: 'Smith.John@contoso.com'.

- Passwords. Implement a convention for the initial password of the newly created user. Figure out a way for the new users to receive their password in a secure way. Methods commonly used include generating a random password and emailing it to the new user or their manager.
